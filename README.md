Project Title: **Basic Python Text-to-Speech Chatbot**

### Overview of the Project:
This project is a straightforward text-to-speech chatbot that speaks text using Python and the `pyttsx3` module. The chatbot converses with the user by providing conversational answers to pre-programmed basic inquiries. It generates greetings, responds to user inquiries, and speaks text-to-speech (TTS) responses using simple routines. Basic inquiries like "What is your name?" and "What is your favorite color?" are intended to be asked by the chatbot, and it will reply to them appropriately. 

The user is greeted by the bot at first, and it keeps answering their queries until they choose to stop or don't provide any information at all. Additionally, it speaks the responses out loud using the chatbot's text-to-speech skills. 

There are a few fundamental inquiries defined.
Depending on what the user says, the chatbot provides tailored responses.
It reacts with an appropriate response if the input is a specified query. If not, it requests that the user attempt an alternative query.
When a user says "quit" or gives no feedback, the chatbot thanks them and moves on.
Lastly, it ends the program with a goodbye message.


Features of the Project:
The bot extends a warm greeting to the user as soon as the chat session begins.
Saying goodbye: Before closing the chat, it says goodbye.
Question-Response Handling: Based on input from the user, the bot can respond to a few pre-programmed questions.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: The bot enhances voice engagement by converting text responses into speech using

Technologies Used:
1. Python:
The primary programming language used in this project.
Handles the logic for user input, question-answer interaction, and flow control.

2. pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech Engine):
pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python that works offline and is platform-independent.
It is used to convert the chatbot's text responses into speech, making the interaction more dynamic and user-friendly.
The engine can also be customized in terms of voice, speed, and volume.

4. Random Module:
The Python random module is used to randomly select greetings and farewell messages to make the bot's responses seem less repetitive and more conversational.

6. Console-Based Interaction:
This project uses a console-based interface where the user types questions, and the chatbot responds by both printing and speaking the answer.



Flow of the Program:
1)Start:
The bot greets the user using the greeting() function.
The greeting is displayed on the console and spoken using the pyttsx3 TTS engine.

2)User Interaction:
The user is prompted to enter a question.
The bot checks the input:
If it's one of the predefined questions, it provides the appropriate response.
If the input is empty, the bot thanks the user and ends the chat.
If the user types "quit", the chat is exited.
For each input, the bot speaks the response using pyttsx3.
3)Exit:
Once the user quits or provides no input, the bot says a random farewell message before the program ends.
